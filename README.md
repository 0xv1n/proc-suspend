# proc-suspend
powershell script i wrote that can suspend an arbitrary process (with limits). script was written for research purposes, I am not responsible for how it is used.

There are a few examples of different iterations in this repo (like using `[NTDLL]::NtSuspendProcess` over `[KERNEL32]::SuspendThread`. Nothing is organized, and all iterations were uploaded for documentation/testing. 

Use at your own risk.
